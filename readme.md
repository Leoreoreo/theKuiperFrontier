This is a simple 2D spaceship shooting game. It takes 5 seconds to load the game. Player can read the instructions on the menu page before starting the game. The spaceship moves around when WASD are pressed, and faces and shoots toward the mouse direction. The score and health are displayed on the upper left corner. The enemies are randomly generated. The difficulty level increases depending on the score, and is also indicated by player's bullet color. Shooting the blue enemy can increase the player's health. Collision with the enemy results in loss in health point. The game is over when the health reaches zero. The best score is recorded, and the player can return to the menu page.
